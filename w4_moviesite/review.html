                    Ryder, are back in <em>Paw Patrol: The Movie!</em>

                <p><b>Trivia</b></p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the second time Paw Patrol has shown how one of the members joined the team. In the
                        show, a segment called "Pups Get A Rubble" shows how Rubble joined the team, in the movie Ryder
                        tells the other pups how he found Chase</li>
                    <li>For the role of Ryder, over 1000 young actors auditioned from all over the USA and Canada,
                        before Albertan high school student Will Brisbin got the part.</li>
                    <li>This is the first PAW Patrol film to be released theatrically as the previous three PAW Patrol
                        films: "Mighty Pups", "Ready Race Rescue", and "Jet to the Rescue" were direct to DVD TV movies.
                    </li>
